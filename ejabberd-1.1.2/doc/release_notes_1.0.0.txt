			    ejabberd 1.0.0
			    14 December 2005

   This document describes the main changes in ejabberd 1.0.0. Unique in this
   version is the compliancy with the XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence
   Protocol) standard. ejabberd is the first Open Source Jabber server claiming
   to fully comply to the XMPP standard.

   ejabberd can be downloaded from the Process-one website:
   http://www.process-one.net/en/projects/ejabberd/

   Detailed information can be found in the ejabberd Feature Sheet and User
   Guide which are available on the Process-one website:
   http://www.process-one.net/en/projects/ejabberd/docs.html


   Recent changes include:


Server-to-server Encryption for Enhanced Security

  - Support for STARTTLS and SASL EXTERNAL to secure server-to-server traffic
    has been added.
  - Also, STARTTLS and Dialback has been implemented for server-to-server (s2s)
    connections. Detailed information about these new features can be found on
    http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/s2s-encryption
  - commonName and dNSName fields matching were introduced to ease the process
    of retrieving certificates.
  - Different certificates can be defined for each virtual host.

ODBC Support

  - ODBC support has been improved to allow production use of ejabberd with
    relational databases.
  - Support for vCard storage in ODBC has been added.
  - ejd2odbc.erl is a tool to convert an installation from Erlang's database
    Mnesia to an ODBC compatible relational database.

Native PostgreSQL Support

  - Native PostgreSQL support gives you a better performance when you use
    PostgreSQL.

Shared Roster groups

  - Shared Roster groups support has been enhanced. New is the ability to add
    all registered users to everyone's roster. Detailed information about this
    new feature can be found on http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/shared-roster-all

Web Interface

   - The web interface internal code has been modified for better integration
     and compliancy with J-EAI, an ejabberd-based Enterprise Application
     Integration platform.
   - More XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliancy work was done.

Transports

   - A transport workaround can be enabled during compilation. To do this, you
     can pass the "--enable-roster-gateway-workaround" option to the configure
     script. (./configure --enable-roster-gateway-workaround)
     This option allows transports to add items with subscription "to" in the
     roster by sending <presence type='subscribed'/> stanza to user. This option
     is only needed for JIT ICQ transport.
     Warning: by enabling this option, ejabberd will not be fully XMPP compliant
              anymore.

Documentation and Internationalization

   - Documentation has been extended to cover more topics.
   - Translations have been updated.

Bugfixes

   - This release contains several bugfixes.
   - Among other bugfixes include improvements to the client-to-server (c2s)
     connection management module.
   - Please refer to the ChangeLog file supplied
     with this release regarding all improvements in ejabberd.

Migration Notes

   - Before any migration, ejabberd system and database must be properly
     backed up.
   - When upgrading an ODBC-based installation, you will need to change the
     relational database schema. The following SQL commands must be run on the
     database:
       CREATE SEQUENCE spool_seq_seq;
       ALTER TABLE spool ADD COLUMN seq integer;
       ALTER TABLE spool ALTER COLUMN seq SET DEFAULT nextval('spool_seq_seq');
       UPDATE spool SET seq = DEFAULT;
       ALTER TABLE spool ALTER COLUMN seq SET NOT NULL;
