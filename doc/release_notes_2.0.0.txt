   Recent changes include:


* Clustering and Architecture

- New front-end and back-end cluster architecture for better
  scalability and robustness. Back-end nodes are able to run a fully
  fault-tolerant XMPP router and services, but you can now deploy
  many front-end nodes to share the load without needing to synchronize
  any state with the back-ends.
- All components now run in cluster mode (For example, Multi-User chat
  service and file transfer proxy).
- New load balancing algorithm to support Multi-User chat and gateways
  clustering. More generally it supports any external component load
  balancing.
- ejabberd watchdog to receive warning on suspicious resources consumption.
- Traffic shapers are now supported on components. This protect
  ejabberd from components and gateways abuses.


* Publish and Subscribe

- Complete rewrite of the PubSub module. The new PubSub module is
  plugin-based, allowing developers to create new nodes type. Any
  application can be plugged to ejabberd and can provide rich presence
  as a pubsub plugin.
- Personal Eventing via Pubsub support (XEP-0163). This module is
  implemented as a PubSub service. It supports user mood (XEP-107),
  User Tune (XEP-118), user location (XEP-0080) or user avatar
  (XEP-0084) for example.


* Server to Server (s2s)

- More robust code with connection timeout implementation.
- Support for multiple s2s connections per domain.
- s2s whitelist and blacklist support.
- s2s retrial interval.


* LDAP

- Many enterprise-class enhancements such as better behaviour under
  heavy load.
- Support for LDAP servers pool.
- Simplified use of virtual hosting with LDAP with domain substitution
  in config.
- Ability to match on several userid attibutes.


* Multi-user chat

- Clustering and load balancing support.
- Ability to define default room configuration in ejabberd config file.
- Many anti abuse features have been added:
  . New ACL to limit the creation of persistent room to autorized users.
  . Ability to define the maximum number of users per room.
  . Limitation of the rate of message and presence packets.
  . Limitation of the maximum number of room a user can join at the same time.


* File transfer

- XEP-0065 - Proxy65 file transfer proxy. The proxy can run in
  cluster mode.


* Authentication

- PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) support on *nix systems.
- External Authentication protocol is now fully documented.


* Web client support

- XEP-0124 - BOSH support: BOSH (Bidirectional-streams Over
  Synchronous HTTP) was formerly known as "HTTP binding". It provides
  an efficient alternative to HTTP polling for scalable Web based chat
  solutions.
- HTTP module can now serve static documents (with
  mod_http_fileserver). It is needed for high-performance Web2.0 chat
  / IM application. System administrators can now avoid using a proxy
  (like Apache) that handles much less simultaneous than ejabberd HTTP
  module.
- Added limitations enforcement on HTTP poll and HTTP bind modules
  (bandwidth, packet size).


* System administration

- XEP-0133 - Service administration support. System administrators can
  now perform lot of ejabberd related admin tasks from their XMPP
  client, through adhoc commands.
- Dynamic log levels: Improved logging with more log levels. You can
  now change the loglevel at run time. No performance penalty is
  involved when
- Better command-line tool, with more options available.


* Localization

- ejabberd is now available in 22 languages: Catalan, Chinese, Czech,
  Dutch, English, French, Galicia, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish,
  Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish,
  Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wallon.


* Build and Installer

- Many launch script improvements.
- New translations. The binary installer is now available in Chinese,
  Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish, Russian.
- Makefile now implements uninstall command
- Full MacOSX compliance in Makefile
- Configure script is clever at finding libraries in unusual places.
				   
				   
* Development API

- Several hooks have been added for module developers (most notably
  presence related hooks).
- HTTP request handler to write HTTP based plugins.
- Manage connections IP address.


* Bugfixes

- ejabberd 2.0 also fixes numerous small bugs :) Read the full
  changelog for details.
