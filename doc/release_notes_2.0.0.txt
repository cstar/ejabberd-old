			     xx december 2007

  ejabberd 2.0.0 is a major new version for ejabberd adding plenty of
  new features, performance and scalability improvements and
  architectural changes.

  ejabberd 2.0.0 includes near that 200 improvements over ejabberd
  1.1.x. A complete list of changes can be retrieved from:

   Recent changes include:


* Clustering and Architecture

- New front-end and back-end cluster architecture for better
  scalability and robustness. Back-end nodes are able to run a fully
  fault-tolerant XMPP router and services, but you can now deploy
  many front-end nodes to share the load without needing to synchronize
  any state with the back-ends.
- All components now run in cluster mode (For example, Multi-User chat
  service and file transfer proxy).
- New load balancing algorithm to support Multi-User chat and gateways
  clustering. More generally it supports any external component load
  balancing.
- ejabberd watchdog to receive warning on suspicious resources consumption.
- Traffic shapers are now supported on components. This protect
  ejabberd from components and gateways abuses.


* Publish and Subscribe

- Complete rewrite of the PubSub module. The new PubSub module is
  plugin-based, allowing developers to create new nodes type. Any
  application can be plugged to ejabberd and can provide rich presence
  as a pubsub plugin.
- Personal Eventing via Pubsub support (XEP-0163). This module is
  implemented as a PubSub service. It supports user mood (XEP-107),
  User Tune (XEP-118), user location (XEP-0080) or user avatar
  (XEP-0084) for example.


* Server to Server (s2s)

- More robust code with connection timeout implementation.
- Support for multiple s2s connections per domain.
- s2s whitelist and blacklist support.


* Multi-user chat

- Clustering support


* File transfer

- XEP-0065 - Proxy65 file transfer proxy. The proxy can run in
  cluster mode.


* Authentication

- PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) support on *nix systems.
- External Authentication protocol is now fully documented.


* Web client support

- XEP-0124 - BOSH support: BOSH (Bidirectional-streams Over
  Synchronous HTTP) was formerly known as "HTTP binding". It provides
  an efficient alternative to HTTP polling for scalable Web based chat
  solutions.
- HTTP module can now serve static documents (with
  mod_http_fileserver). It is needed for high-performance Web2.0 chat
  / IM application. System administrators can now avoid using a proxy
  (like Apache) that handles much less simultaneous than ejabberd HTTP
  module.
- Added limitations enforcement on HTTP poll and HTTP bind modules
  (bandwidth, packet size).


* System administration

- Dynamic log levels: Improved logging with more log levels. You can
  now change the loglevel at run time. No performance penality is
  involved when
- Better command-line tool, with more options available.


* Development API

- Several hooks have been added for module developers (most notably
  presence related hooks).


* Build and Installer

- Many launch script improvements.
- New translations. The binary installer is now available in Chinese,
  Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish, Russian.
- Makefile now implements uninstall command
- Full MacOSX compliance in Makefile
- Configure script is clever at finding libraries in unusual places.
