   Recent changes include....


Encrypted server-to-server connections

  - Support for STARTTLS+SASL EXTERNAL for Server-to-Server connections.
  - STARTTLS+Dialback has been implemented for Server-to-Server (s2s)
    connections. Those options are handled with two new config file options
    (s2s_use_starttls and s2s_certfile). See ejabberd.cfg.example for usage
    examples.
  - DNSName certificate field and DNS name matching are supported.
  - Per virtual host certificate can be defined.

ODBC Support

  - ODBC support has been improved to allow production use of ejabberd with
    relational databases.
  - Support for VCard storage in ODBC has been added.
  - ejd2odbc.erl: is a program that convert an installation from Erlang Mnesia
    database to an ODBC relational database.

Native PostgreSQL support

  - Native postgreSQL support has been added: You can now use a PostgreSQL
    database without the need to go through the ODBC driver.

Shared roster

  - Shared roster support have been improved: You can specify all users in a
    virtual host for addition in a group.

Web interface

   - The Web interface internal code has been modified for better integration
     and compliance with J-EAI.
   - The Web interface is now compliant to XHTML 1.0 Transitional.
   - Several bugs have been fixed.

Transports

   - A transport workaround can be enabled with the compile time option. You
     can pass the "--enable-roster-gateway-workaround" option to the configure
     script. For example:
     ./configure --enable-roster-gateway-workaround
     This option allows to add items with subscription "to" in roster by
     sending <presence type='subscribed'/> stanza to user. This option is
     needed for JIT ICQ transport.
     Warning: By using this option, ejabberd is not fully XMPP compliant.

Documentation and translations

   - Documentation has been improved to cover more topics.
   - Translations have been updated to support the new features.

     Among other bugfixes include improvements Client-to-Server connection
     management module. Please refer to the ChangeLog file supplied with this

Migration

   - Before any migration, ejabberd system and database must be properly
     backed-up.
   - System migrating from a previous ODBC based install will need to change
     their relational database schema. The following SQL commands must be run
     on the database:
    CREATE SEQUENCE spool_seq_seq;
    ALTER TABLE spool ADD COLUMN seq integer;
    ALTER TABLE spool ALTER COLUMN seq SET DEFAULT nextval('spool_seq_seq');
    UPDATE spool SET seq = DEFAULT;
    ALTER TABLE spool ALTER COLUMN seq SET NOT NULL;
