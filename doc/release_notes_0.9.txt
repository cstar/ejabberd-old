    This document describes the major new features of and changes to

    For more detailed information, please refer to ejabberd User
    Guide.


Virtual Hosting

    ejabberd now can host several domain on the same instance.
    This option is enabled by using:

      {hosts, ["erlang-projects.org", "erlang-fr.org"]}.

    instead of the previous host directive.

    Note that you are now using a list of hosts. The main one should
    be the first listed. See migration section further in this release
    note for details.
      

Shared Roster

    Shared roster is a new feature that allow the ejabberd
    administrator to add jabber user that will be present in the
    roster of every users on the server.
    Shared roster are enabled by adding:

            {mod_shared_roster, []}

    at the end of your module list in your ejabberd.cfg file.


PostgreSQL (ODBC) support

    This feature is experimental and not yet properly documented. This
    feature is released for testing purpose.

    You need to have Erlang/OTP R10 to compile with ODBC on various
    flavour of *nix. You should use Erlang/OTP R10B-4, as this task
    has became easier with this release. It comes already build in
    Erlang/OTP Microsoft Windows binary.

    PostgreSQL support is enabled by using the following module in
    ejabberd.cfg instead of their standard counterpart:

     mod_last_odbc.erl
     mod_offline_odbc.erl
     mod_roster_odbc.erl

    The database schema is located in the src/odbc/pq.sql file.

    Look at the src/ejabberd.cfg.example file for more information on
    how to configure ejabberd with odbc support. You can get support
    on how to configure ejabberd with a relational database.


Migration from ejabberd 0.7.5

    Migration is pretty straightforward as Mnesia database schema
    conversions is handled automatically. Remember however that you
    must backup your ejabberd database before migration.

    Here are the following steps to proceed:

    1. Stop your instance of ejabberd.

    2. In ejabberd.cfg, define the host lists. Change the host
    directive to the hosts one:
    Before:
      {host, "erlang-projects.org"}.
    After:
      {hosts, ["erlang-projects.org", "erlang-fr.org"]}.
    Note that when you restart the server the existing users will be
    affected to the first virtual host, so the order is important. You
    should keep the previous hostname as the first virtual host.

    3. Restart ejabberd.
