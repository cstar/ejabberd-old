Enhanced virtual hosting

   Virtual hosting now applies to much more setting options and
   features and is now transparent. Virtual hosting accepts different
   parameters for different virtual hosts regarding the following
   features: Authentication method, Access Control List and access
   rules, users management, statistics and shared roster. The web
   interface now gives access to each virtual host's parameters.


Enhanced publish and subscribe module

   ejabberd pubsub module now integrates enhancements coming from
   J-EAI, an XMPP-based integration server built on ejabberd. ejabberd
   thus supports publish and subscribe node configuration. It is
   possible to define nodes that should be persistant, and the number
   of items to persist. It is also possible to define various
   notification parameters, such as the delivery of the payload with
   the notifications, the notification of subscribers when some
   changes occur on items, the maximum size of the items payload, the
   subscription approvers, the limitation of the notification to
   online users only, etc.


Code reorganisation and update

   - The mod_register have been cleaned up.
   - ODBC support have been updated and several bugs have been fixed.


Development API

   To ease the work of Jabber/XMPP developers, a filter_packet hook
   has been added. It is thus possible to develop specific plugin to
   filter or modify packets flowing through ejabberd.


Translations

   Translations have been updated to support the new pubsub features.
   A new Brazilian Portuguese translation has been added.


Web interface

   CSS stylesheets are now W3C compliant.


Installers

   Installers are now provided for Microsoft Windows and Linux/x86. The
   Linux installer now includes Erlang ASN.1 modules for LDAP
   authentication support.
