   Recent changes include....


Enhanced virtual hosting

   Virtual hosting applies to many more setting options and
   features and is transparent. Virtual hosting accepts different
   parameters for different virtual hosts regarding the following
   features: authentication method, access control lists and access
   rules, users management, statistics, and shared roster. The web
   interface gives access to each virtual host's parameters.


Enhanced Publish-Subscribe module

   ejabberd's Publish-Subscribe module integrates enhancements
   coming from J-EAI, an XMPP-based integration server built on
   ejabberd. ejabberd thus supports Publish-Subscribe node
   configuration. It is possible to define nodes that should be
   persistent, and the number of items to persist. Besides that, it
   is also possible to define various notification parameters, such
   as the delivery of the payload with the notifications, and the
   notification of subscribers when some changes occur on items.
   Other examples are: the maximum size of the items payload, the
   subscription approvers, the limitation of the notification to
   online users only, etc.


Code reorganisation and update

   - The mod_register module has been cleaned up.
   - ODBC support has been updated and several bugs have been fixed.


Development API

   To ease the work of Jabber/XMPP developers, a filter_packet hook
   has been added. As a result it is possible to develop plugins to
   filter or modify packets flowing through ejabberd.


Translations

   - Translations have been updated to support the new Publish-Subscribe features.
   - A new Brazilian Portuguese translation has been contributed.


Web interface

   - The CSS stylesheet from the web interface is W3C compliant.


Installers

   Installers are provided for Microsoft Windows and Linux/x86. The
   Linux installer includes Erlang ASN.1 modules for LDAP
   authentication support.


Bugfixes

   - This release contains several bugfixes and architectural
     changes. Among other bugfixes include improvements in LDAP
     authentication. Please refer to the ChangeLog file supplied 
     with this release regarding all improvements in ejabberd.
