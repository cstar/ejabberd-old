#
# In this file you can configure options that are passed by ejabberdctl 
# to the erlang runtime system when starting ejabberd
#

# POLL: Kernel polling (+K [true|false])
#
# The kernel polling option requires support in the kernel.
# Additionaly, you need to enable this feature while compiling Erlang.
#
# Default: +K false
#
#POLL="+K true"

# SMP: SMP support (-smp [enable|auto|disable])
#
# Explanation in Erlang/OTP documentation:
# enable: starts the Erlang runtime system with SMP support enabled. 
#   This may fail if no runtime system with SMP support is available.
# auto: starts the Erlang runtime system with SMP support enabled if it
#   is available and more than one logical processor are detected.
# disable: starts a runtime system without SMP support.
#
# Default: -smp disable
#
#SMP="-smp auto"

# ERL_MAX_PORTS: Maximum number of simultaneously open Erlang ports
#
# ejabberd consumes two or three ports for every connection, either 
# from a client or from another Jabber server. So take this into
# account when setting this limit.
#
# Default: 1024
# Maximum: 268435456
#
export ERL_MAX_PORTS=32000

# PROCESSES: Maximum number of Erlang processes
#
# Erlang consumes a lot of lightweight processes. If there is a lot of activity
# on ejabberd so that the maximum number of proccesses is reached, people will
# experiment greater latency times. As these processes are implemented in
# Erlang, and therefore not related to the operating system processes, you do
# not have to worry about allowing a huge number of them.
#
# Default: 32768
# Maximum: 268435456
#
#PROCESSES="+P 32768"

# ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES: Maximum number of ETS and Mnesia tables
#
# The number of concurrent ETS and Mnesia tables is limited. When the limit is
# reached, errors will appear in the logs:
#   ** Too many db tables **
# You can safely increase this limit when starting ejabberd. It impacts memory
# consumption but the difference will be quite small.
#
# Default: 1400
#
#ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES="-env ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES 1400"

# ERL_FULLSWEEP_AFTER: Maximum number of collections before a forced fullsweep
#
# To reduce memory usage, you can set environment variable ERL_FULLSWEEP_AFTER.
# But in this case ejabberd may work slower.
#
# The ERL_FULLSWEEP_AFTER option shrinks the size of the Erlang process after
# RAM intensive events. Note that this option may downgrade performance. Hence
# this option is only interesting on machines that also host other services
# (webserver, mail) on which ejabberd does not receive constant load.
#
# Default: 65535
#
#export ERL_FULLSWEEP_AFTER=0

# The next variable allows to explicitly specify erlang node for ejabberd
# It can be given in different formats:
# ERLANG_NODE=ejabberd
#   Lets erlang add hostname to the node (ejabberd uses short name in this case)
# ERLANG_NODE=ejabberd@hostname
#   Erlang uses node name as is (so make sure that hostname is a real
#   machine hostname or you'll not be able to control ejabberd)
# ERLANG_NODE=ejabberd@hostname.domainname
#   The same as previous, but erlang will use long hostname 
#   (see erl (1) manual for details)
#
#export ERLANG_NODE=ejabberd
